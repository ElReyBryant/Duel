    <h1>Duel</h1>
    <h2>By Bryant Urena</h2>
    <p>This is story of samurai getting revenge on ninja that attack and took his right eye. I made it because I wanted to tell a simple story without using any text to convey what is going on and also because I think samurai's and ninja's are cool :).</p>
